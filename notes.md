## Ideas

#### Enemies

* **Petard** :
  * If the player is in its range it will follow him then blow up costing him HP/HEARTS. 

#### General

* Perhaps every sub-entity should have an update function that get called in the Entity class Update function as a call back to which you send the diff between the old position and the new one.
